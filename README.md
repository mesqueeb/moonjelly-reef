# Moonjelly Reef

An orchestration framework for AI agent workflows. A short-lived pulse scans for work, dispatches skills, and goes back to sleep. State lives in tags. The reef does the rest.

This framework is **Issue tracker agnostic**. GitHub Issues, Jira, ClickUp, Linear, any kanban board or simply local MD files. Use yours.

## Install

```sh
npx skills@latest add mesqueeb/moonjelly-reef
```

On first run, reef-pulse will prompt you to configure your issue tracker and install optional dependencies (`tdd`, `ubiquitous-language`).

## 🪼 The moonjelly pulse

> _Through Moonjelly's pulse, the reef is orchestrated, creatures are set in motion, and Moonjelly recedes._

The moonjelly is the orchestrator. A short-lived session (cron or manual) that scans tags, dispatches skills, and exits. It holds no state — tags are the state. Each pulse: scan → dispatch → exit.

## Skills

<details>
<summary>🤿 <b><code>/reef-scope</code></b> — scope an issue</summary>

The single entry point for turning ideas into plans. Determines whether the work is a feature, refactor, or bug, interviews the diver if needed, writes a plan with **success criteria**, and tags `to-slice`.

<details>
<summary>🤿 / 🌊 <b><code>/reef-pulse</code></b> — the orchestrator</summary>

Scans all tagged issues, dispatches the appropriate phase for each as a sub-agent, and exits. Holds no state — tags are the state. Run with `--hitl` (manual, includes 🤿 items) or `--afk` (cron, 🌊 only).

Design principles:

- **Testing at source**: each transition includes verification before tagging.
- **Small batches**: slices flow independently and concurrently.
- **Human = bottleneck**: minimize 🤿 states. Only two: scope, land.
- **No heroics**: agents that are stuck flag + move on, never spiral.
- **Make work visible**: the tags ARE the visibility.

Finds the open PR for the issue and presents it to the diver. The diver approves (merge + close), requests re-scoping, or sends it back for new slices.

## Pulse phase details

These are the 🌊 automated phases dispatched by `/reef-pulse`. Each phase reads its instructions from a file under `reef-pulse/`.

<details>
<summary>🌊 <b><code>to-slice</code></b> 🏷️</summary>

Automatically breaks the plan into vertical slices, or determines a single slice is enough to tackle the plan.

- 🔶　single-slice: plan becomes the slice, tags `to-implement`, no target branch.
- 🔷　multi-slice: create target branch, sub-issues, coverage matrix, tag slices `to-implement` or `to-await-waves`.

Check if a blocked slice's dependencies are all done. If yes, re-review the plan against current code and tag `to-implement`. If not, exit — next pulse will check again.

Implement a slice using TDD in a git worktree. Create worktree → read context → red-green-refactor for each acceptance criterion → write report → open PR → tag `to-inspect`.

Independently verify a slice PR. Run the full test suite, check each acceptance criterion against actual code, do trivial cleanups. Tag `to-merge` if approved, `to-rework` if gaps found.

## Git hygiene

Every agent works in its own git worktree — the main checkout is never touched. For multi-slice work, a target branch is created from the base branch; slice PRs target it. For single-slice work, the target branch equals the base branch. Every phase creates its own worktree and tears it down before exiting. Every git operation begins with `git fetch origin --prune`. No `--force` flags, ever.

## Autopilot

Run the reef on autopilot so it pulses while you're away. In any Claude Code session:

```
/reef-pulse --afk
```

This runs a single AFK pulse (automated work only, no human prompts). To make it recurring, create a durable cron:

```
CronCreate cron="7 * * * *" prompt="/reef-pulse --afk" durable=true
```

This persists to `.claude/scheduled_tasks.json` and survives session restarts. It runs locally, so your git and GitHub credentials just work. Adjust the cron expression to your preferred interval (e.g. `"*/30 * * * *"` for every 30 minutes).

## Companion skill

<details>
<summary>🛡️ <b><code>git-guardrails-claude-code</code></b></summary>

Blocks dangerous git commands (force push, hard reset, force delete) while allowing safe everyday operations like pushing from worktrees and cleaning up merged branches — exactly what reef agents do all day.
